username=don, password=ron is one user we have created that works. You can also create a new user and log in as that.

When adding an event, use January as month 0.

Creative portion: 

There are three different pre-made themes that you can select from to completely change the color scheme of the calendar. Additionally, you can make your own theme to change the color scheme by making color selctions for different aspects of the calendar.
You can tag an event as 'important' and when you view the event in a popup window, a message will be displayed saying "This event is important!" You can also untag this event, or tag an event that was not originally marked as important, while editing in the popup window.
When making a new event you have the option to make it a group event. This will cause the event to show up on both your calendar and the calendar of the user whose username you enter in the box. Leave the box blank if you don't want to make a group event. 
you can make a group event which will make the event appear on yours and another users calendar. If you enter a username that is not valid, the event will just be added to your calendar.
